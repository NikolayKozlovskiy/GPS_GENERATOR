# GPS_Generator class manipulates the users' ans netwroks' class(es) to create final gps results and its followings (e.g., metadata)
INIT:
  GPS_GENERATOR_PATH: "gps_synth.gps_generator"
  GPS_GENERATOR_CLASS: "GPS_Generator"

# Current logic:
# # a new profile is created if either network's or users' params are changed (ideally, date ranges of users should not overlap)
# # each new profile should have understandable and unique profile name
# # to create a network one class Netwrok is used since by now the workflow for netwrok creation seem universal
# # profiles can share a similiar (identical) network (meaning network params are the same) and this is why a network should be referenced by its own unique name not profile name
# # this is done for the sake of efficiency so if two profiles have the same network params we don't compute identical networks (and also store it) but use already created
# # to create users several classes could be used, but each of them should have an abstract class User as their parent
# # profiles can not have the same users' GPS data (meaning that even if users params are identical still output GPS data (trajectories) will be different)
# # this is why users (or more precisely their output GPS) can be referenced by profile names althouhg it may cause some confusion
